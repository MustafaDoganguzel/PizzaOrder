🍕 Pizza Order App 🚀
Welcome to Pizza Order App, a fully functional React-based Single Page Application (SPA) where users can customize their pizza orders in real-time! Built as part of my Workintech Full-Stack Developer Training (Week 8), this project showcases my skills in state management, form validation, and component-based UI design.


🎯 Features
✅ Live Order Customization – Users can select pizza size, toppings, and extras while seeing price updates dynamically.
✅ Order Summary Page – Displays final order details before confirmation.
✅ Form Validation & Error Handling – Ensures correct input with instant feedback.
✅ Responsive Design – Works seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
✅ Smooth Navigation – React Router enables easy transitions between pages.
✅ Tested & Reliable – Cypress ensures proper functionality through automated testing.
